## Participants

## Discussion Points

#### Are there any missing key features?

#### Priorities of unimplemented features

#### Recommendations for performance comparisons

#### When considering an alternative to React, what would be a motivating factor: what improvements over current workflow will make it worth considering?

#### What would be an immediate, obvious dealbreaker?

#### What, if any, are the real world pain points with React?

#### Do you have any interest in code parsing/transpiling for your teamâ€™s workflow? (for example: custom linters, code generators, auto migration tools)

#### Are there any insights you wish you had about your codebase/development process?

#### In the wix context, assuming that on a technical level TSXAir is appealing to your needs, what would make adoption difficult? other than the generic aversion to changes to dev stack, specific technical and organizational challenges will be appreciated

# TsxAir Project Motivations

## What do we want?
- A minimal, simple, lightweight component based framework
- Compile time optimization with *minimal runtime*
- Declarative component syntax, ideally TSX/JSX
- TypeScript support

## Some other requirements
- Great tooling, autocomplete for code and templates, including props and events
- As close to vanilla as possible
- As close to W3C standard as possible
- No virtual DOM
- A smooth transition from React
- SSR
- Code splitting
- Highly optimized, based on data volatility (ie, if the attributes are fixed, pure functional component can be replaced by a string/template)

## Short Term Project Goals
- Complete a React adjacent feature set
- Generate community and in house interest and feedback
- Benchmarking and Demos
- Improve on React in developer experience
- Create migration path from other frameworks

## Long Term Project Goals
- Replace React

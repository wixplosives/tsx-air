# Project Status

## Current
- Components compile to a performant runnable, Sample apps  size (framework included) ~50k (10k zipped)
- Playground is functional with zero design
- Interactive examples are used as demo and testing platform
- No attempts at optimizations were made other than forgoing of the VDom
- Some key features are not implemented: SSR and dynamic children are limited, global stores, composite/high order hooks, context, portal, async rendering

## Coming Soon
- Full dynamic/static children support (repeaters, cloneElement etc)
- High order hooks
- Context (or equivalent)

## Technical Roadmap
- Complete React feature set
- User facing interactive documentation and playground design
- Performance testing and optimizations
- Performance comparisons with other frameworks 
- Semi automated migration path from React
- Demos
- Common components library

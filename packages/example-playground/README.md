# Schema Playground

**Schema Playground** is a developer tool that simplifies creating new auto-generated views from source files

The "schema extraction" process, which transforms source typescript files to JSON schema, is handled by the [typescript-schema-extract](../typescript-schema-extract) project.

## Getting started

Run `yarn start`, a browser will open and load the playground. When you change source files in `typescript-schema-extract` or `schema-views` the playground will automatically reflect those changes.

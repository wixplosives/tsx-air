Quick animation of digits using only props and state changes and **no refs** 

## Showcases

- Element props spreading
- Using _notAProp to make a field be ignored when props spreading
- $textContent special prop
- Deep mutable state
- lifecycle.render()

## Notes

- This is pretty much impossible in react. The VDom is way too slow, and you have to use refs to circumvent the rendering engine and JSX
